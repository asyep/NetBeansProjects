### 2.1. External API Integration: Exchange Rate Service with Fallback

Finova's real-time currency conversion capability is powered by the `CurrencyAPI.java` module, which integrates with an external RESTful API service to fetch up-to-date USD to IDR exchange rates. This module employs Java's `HttpURLConnection` to execute HTTP GET requests, retrieving JSON-formatted data from the designated API endpoint. A critical aspect of this implementation is its built-in fallback mechanism; if the primary API URL fails to respond, `CurrencyAPI.java` automatically attempts to fetch data from a secondary, backup URL. This ensures a higher degree of service availability and resilience. The retrieved data, consisting of the date and the IDR rate, is then parsed and made available within the application, primarily for display on the home screen and for use in budgeting reports, thereby supporting accurate international financial planning.
