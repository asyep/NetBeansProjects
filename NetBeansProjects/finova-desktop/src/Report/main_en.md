# Finova Desktop Test Report

## Test Summary

Testing of the Finova Desktop application was conducted using JUnit 4 as the primary testing framework. The tests covered various application components, including authentication modules (Login and SignUp), database management, PDF export, and the main user interface (HomePage). The testing approach employed unit and integration testing to ensure application functionality and reliability.

## Test Methodology

The following methodologies were employed:

1.  **Unit Testing**: Individual functions and methods were tested to ensure they performed according to specifications.
2.  **Integration Testing**: Interactions between components were tested, particularly those involving the database.
3.  **Reflection Testing**: The Java Reflection API was used to access and test private methods and attributes.
4.  **UI Testing**: UI component initialization and behavior were verified.

## Testing Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges:

1.  **Testing Private Methods**: Some critical functionalities were implemented in private methods, which are not directly accessible for testing.

    - **Solution**: Utilized the Java Reflection API to access and test private methods.

2.  **Database Dependency**: Many components relied on an active database connection.

    - **Solution**: Implemented setup and teardown methods to manage database connections during testing.

3.  **UI Components**: Testing UI components without actual user interaction.

    - **Solution**: Focused on testing UI initialization and verifying UI component properties.

4.  **Database Column Structure**: Some tests encountered issues due to mismatched column names in SQL queries.
    - **Solution**: Corrected SQL queries to use the proper column names as per the database schema.

## Conclusion

Testing of the Finova Desktop application demonstrated an average test coverage of 83.57%. The tests successfully identified and rectified several issues, particularly related to input validation, database interaction, and UI consistency. The comprehensive testing approach ensures that the application functions according to specifications and provides a reliable user experience.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1.  **Improve Test Coverage**: Increase test coverage for components with coverage below 80%.
2.  **Automated UI Testing**: Implement automated UI testing to simulate user interactions.
3.  **Mock Database**: Utilize a mock database to reduce dependency on the production database during testing.
4.  **Performance Testing**: Add performance testing to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
